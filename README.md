## 1. General

Repository for experimental ESPHome codes (yaml files).

ESPHome is a system for generating firmware for ESP32 / ESP8266 boards and uploading this wirelessly to WIFI capable boards. For more information on ESPHome, see reference 1.

Normally the firmware (a binary file) is obtained writing C++ code or C++ - like code (Arduino .ino)  and compiling this. ESPHome uses a yaml file containing a description of the firmware functionality. The system converts this into the C++ code and subsequently compiles it. The generated C++ code and the firmware file (.bin)  


## 2. Basic example
**Assumption:**  you have an ESPHome server up and running and have access to the dashboard.


I have a server running under Docker on my Synology NAS. I can access the ESPHome dashboard in my browser with http://NAS-IP:6052, which uses the default port number. The docker container uses an external bound volume, which means that contents of the /config folder of the application is directly accessible for me on the storage volume of the NAS.

In this example I will create the firmware for a very basic application on a SB-NodeMCU-ESP32 board from Joy-It (https://joy-it.net/en/products/SBC-NodeMCU-ESP32).     
Documentation for this board can be found here: https://joy-it.net/files/files/Produkte/SBC-NodeMCU-ESP32/SBC-NodeMCU-ESP32-Manual-20200320.pdf

This is a very affordable ESP32 board. It has one huge disadvantage if you want to use it for experimenting with connection of other hardware to it's pins:  the board does NOT fit on normal breadboards. The distance between the two pin rows does not fit with the breadboard spacing. There are solutions available for this on the web, but it takes some cutting...

ESPHome is capable of doing over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates. It should be evident that before it is possible to do OTA updates, the firmware must be capable to receive those. This requires a WIFI connection and a routine to receive updates over WIFI. The very first firmware with this minimum capabilities must be loaded to the board over a wired (USB) connection. All subsequent updates can be done over-the-air. Unless something is wrong with the latest firmware uploaded to the board or something is wrong with the WIFI connection.

If the root cause of failure is in the firmware, a repaired firmware version must be uploaded via a USB connection. For cases where the previously used WIFI network is not available a fallback solution can be built into the firmware. After a predetermined number of connection attempts, the board can go into access point (AP) mode and serve a webpage where the user can set the credentials for an available wireless network. The board can then reboot and start connecting to the set network. Note, that after a subsequent firmware update the edited WIFI settings are lost and the user must set them again (see TODO 2).  

After completion of the basic firmware example, the board will be able to:
         
- connect to an available WIFI network
- receive OTA firmware updates
- go to AP mode and accept edited WIFI creedentials in case connection fails
         
**Next steps:**         

1. create yaml file with basic functionality         
2. compile / create firmware.bin
3. download firmware.bin to PC
4. upload firmware via USB
5. check logs (via USB, via ESP log over WIFI)
6. disconnect from USB
7. reboot and check logs (ESP log over WIFI)         
8. make some firmware changes in yaml file
9. compile and upload (OTA)
10. inspect logs
         
### 1. create yaml file with basic functionality
         
Open ESPHome dashboard in browser
Create new node (+ button) 
Follow the steps in the wizzard       
Enter node name: joyit_nodemcu_esp32_ex
Select device type: Generic ESP32 (WROVER Module)
WiFi & Updates: WiFi credentials, OTA password
Submit
         

After this a file **joyit_nodemcu_esp32_ex.yaml** has been created in the /config folder. You can view it's contents [here](https://github.com/goofy2k/ESPhome_codes/blob/main/media/joyit_nodemcu_esp32_ex.yaml).
         
The file can be viewed and edited under the Edit button. The credentials for the fallback hotspot (AP) have been automatically generated. You may have to note those in case you have to connect to the hotspot.           
With **"Validate"** the contents of the yaml file can be validated. As this yaml file is auto-generated by the wizzard, the result is obviously positive. Once you start adding features by hand this feature is very useful as the yaml format is very sensitive to details :-)
It makes no sense to use the Upload as the board does not yet have WiFi connection and OTA capabilities. The Upload button actually first creates the binary by compilation and uploads it to the board in one go. You can try Logs and see from the messages that the board is not yet connected to the ESPHome API server.

### 2. compile / create firmware.bin
         
The firmware must be created without trying to upload it: choose **"Compile"** from the three dot menu of the board's box in the dashboard. In this action the C++ code is composed and saved in the /config [folder](https://github.com/goofy2k/ESPhome_codes/blob/main/media/esphome_files.jpg). The compiled firmware is stored somewhat [deeper](https://github.com/goofy2k/ESPhome_codes/blob/main/media/firmware_location.jpg) in this folder.

         
![alt text](https://github.com/goofy2k/ESPhome_codes/blob/main/media/esphome_files.jpg "/config folder")
![alt text](https://github.com/goofy2k/ESPhome_codes/blob/main/media/firmware_location.jpg "location of firmware")         
         
         
### 3. download firmware.bin to PC
         
With **"DOWNLOAD BINARY"** in the ESPHome dashboard, the firmware is downloaded to your PC.  So you don't have to dig into the /config folder to get the file. A file **joyit_nodemcu_esp32_ex.bin** is now in your downloads folder. Close the window (**"CLOSE"**).
         
### 4. upload / flash firmware via USB
(requires a upload application)
Flashing of the file to the board over USB can be done with the ESPHome-flasher. Read this: 
https://esphome.io/guides/faq.html#i-can-t-get-flashing-over-usb-to-work
and get the program over here:         
https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases

         
start ESPHome-Flasher-1.3.0-Windows-x64.exe 
choose COM part
select file 
Flash   and see messages appear
         
flasher_output.log 
         
### 5. check logs (via USB, via ESP log over WIFI)
Check logs  (board_logs.log)
         
cannot connect, board is on wifi

### Remarks:         

The source codes (in this case yaml files!) are saved in the /config folder and have the device/application name (appname.yaml). The output (C++ code, compiled firmware(?)) are stored in a separate folder per app:  /config/appname.  Other resources must be stored in .....          
         

## 3. TODO

1. Put secrets (credentials, host IP's etc) in a separate file and do not publish those. Test Secrets Editor.
2. Find a solution for keeping WIFI credentials after a firmware update
3. Investigate "Update All"
4. Investigate "Clean MQTT" 
5. Investigate "Clean Build"
6. Discuss (high level) integration in Home Assistant
